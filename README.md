# Hello!

My name is Vinay and I am a Graduate with a 1st Class Honours in Computer Science. I am passionate about programming and love to learn about new technologies. 

Currently I am working on creating a game using the Unity Engine. I have a Devlog where you can follow my progress [here!](https://infernalarena.wordpress.com/)

More recently I have been learning **Power BI** and aim to get more involved with **Django**, **Firebase**, and **C++**.

I am also looking for work in the technology space! Feel free to contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinay-kirk-pal/) or via my email vinaypal5555@gmail.com
