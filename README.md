# Hello!

:wave: My name is Vinay and I am a Graduate with a 1st Class Honours in Computer Science. I am passionate about programming and love to learn about new technologies. 

:video_game: Currently I am working on creating a game using the Unity Engine. I have a Devlog where you can follow my progress [here!](https://infernalarena.wordpress.com/)

:star: More recently I have been learning **Rust** which i've been enjoying so far - it is very different from anything i've learnt so far!

:star: I also aim to get more involved with **Django**, **PostgreSQL**, and **C++**.
